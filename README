*****************************************
SERVICE COMPOSITION FRAMEWORK FOR ANDROID
*****************************************

-------------
Project Scope:
--------------

The project will focus on developing a service composition framework for Android.
We would like to have a framework that is able to do the following things

1) Detect what are the services available to offer.
2) Keeps track of a database of users (bluetooth paired devices).
3) Runs an android service to deal with opportunistic bluetooth communication
   with the users in the vicinity.
4) The android service in 3) will be responsible for appropriate file transfers.
   These files could be of two types. Request & result files. 
5) Finally we'd like the users to enjoy the marvels of opportunistic (ahem ahem) 
   service  composition :P  



---------
Platform:
---------

Android 2.1 update 1

------------------
Services to offer:
------------------

We'd like the services (not to be confused by Android background service for
managing connection threads) to have a plug and play feature. This should 
allow us to scale the number of services later on and simply add them to the 
core of the app.

Services should have :
1) A certain meta data associated with them. The following was drafted after a
   useful discussion with Sujoy. 
	Meta-data: (XML file maybe)
	---------
	These can be, but not limited to  
		1) Unique service identifier
		2) A name as a 'string'
		3) Estimated time to offer this service e.g if its a compression service
			we would have t = f(x) ; where x is the i/p file size of the file to 
			compress and t shall be the time it takes to compress this file.
			This can be useful in the case when a particular device is overloaded 
			and cannot handle further compression etc. requests.
	 	
2) Should have a common interface to talk to the core
	(I am unsure of this for now as to what exactly would be the interface)
